# Jorge de la Flor

**Embedded & Micro AI Developer · Python & Rust · From hardware to business impact**

I build systems that live close to the data: microcontrollers, edge devices and integrations that connect hardware, software and business.

---

## 🧠 About me

- Specialized in **embedded systems**, **Micro AI** and solutions in **Python** and **Rust**.  
- Background in **International Business**, which helps translate business needs into real technical systems.  
- Beyond the list of technologies, what matters to me is that every **project** has a **clear purpose**. I care about making things **simpler**, **faster** and more **reliable** for everyone. I am always looking for ways to **optimize** each system a bit further.
